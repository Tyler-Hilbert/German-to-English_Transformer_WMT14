# CUDA-Transformer
This project is in progress. It's mostly reference transformer code (in Python).  
The "main project" [is in this subdirectory](https://github.com/Tyler-Hilbert/Transformer-WMT14-English_To_German/tree/main/Reference/ArjunSarkar_BuildingYourOwnTransformerFromScratch). It's a PyTorch implementation of the original transformer model using WMT14 English/German sentence pairs.  

## Until this project is complete, feel free to check out more completed projects that resemble what I'm building towards:  
1) https://github.com/Tyler-Hilbert/CUDA-KMeans  
2) https://github.com/Tyler-Hilbert/CUDA-LinearRegression  
3) https://github.com/Tyler-Hilbert/CUDA-SVM
